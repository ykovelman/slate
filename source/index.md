# Introduction

Welcome to the MJM Shipping API! You can use our API to access MJM Shipping API endpoints, which can get information on various quotes, shipment bookings, shipment tracking in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and Java! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'mjm'

api = MJM::APIClient.authorize!('shipment')
```

```python
import mjm

api = mjm.authorize('shipment')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: shipment"
```

> Make sure to replace `shipment` with your API key.

MJM Shipping uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new MJM Shipping API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

MJM Shipping expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>shipping</code> with your personal API key.
